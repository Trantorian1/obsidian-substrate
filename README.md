This is a repository intended for personal use in the study of the [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) Rust SDK and ecosystem. This is *not* intended as a guide but might serve to give useful insights onto the topic at hand. In essence, this is a more hands-on examination of Substrate and blockchain technology, and how they might be used.

> ⚠️ Prior experience with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and blockchain technologies is assumed
